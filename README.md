# Room Allocation System

## Description of the Problem
I am studying in one of UWC schools, which is a residential school that has students coming from all parts of the world – more than 60 countries, and “diversity” is amongst the core values of all United World Colleges. Therefore, when allocating student rooms, it is always better for students in each room to come from different countries and continents. However, more than a quarter of the total students are from India, and it poses difficulties for the head of residential life in our school to achieve a full-scale diverse room allocation using manual allocation method. For example, it happens that in some rooms all 4 students are from Asia.

## Description of the Solution
This room allocation system uses a customized ***Genetic Algorithm*** to optimize for the room allocation in order to achieve the maximum diversity in student dormitories based on their nationalities (and continent).

This is a customized software for United World Colleges around the globe which offers a two-year IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme)

## System Requirements
* JDK 9 (recommended) or above
* JavaFX library

## Success Criteria
* A login system is included
* The client can input student and dormitory data into the software easily
* All the data can be stored and maintained in a database
* The client can update the student and dormitory data in the software easily
* The client can check if a student is already allocated
* The client can find where the students are allocated
* The allocation of students can be visualized
* The client can load different allocation files
* Students are allocated to optimize for diversity in all rooms
* The allocation can be exported to a spreadsheet.
